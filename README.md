# HR-Analytics

HR-Analytics, Here is an opportunity to try predictive analytics in identifying the employees most likely to get promoted.

## Dataset:

This [dataset](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/wns-analytics-hackathon-2018-1/) is of Hackathon organized by Analytics Vidhya platform

## Description:

This is a 8 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive.

It achieved 84.57% of accuracy with this CNN trained on a CPU, which took me about a 5-10minute. If you dont have a GPU powered machine it might take a little longer, you can try reducing the epochs (steps) to reduce computation.

## Code Requirements:

python 3.x with following modules installed

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) - Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook

or

[notebook](https://pypi.org/project/notebook/)


## Installation & Execution:

[How to install Jupyter Notebook](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-in-windows/)

## Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - High-level programming language

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to gain introductory exposure to Deep Learning Classification concepts. The project makes heavy use of Keras(tensorflow in backend) and Opencv2 Libraries.
